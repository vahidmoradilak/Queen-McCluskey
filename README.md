# Queen-McCluskey
  piAndEpi
This program runs the Queen-McCluskey algorithm. This program is written for a function with five inputs but can be easily generalized to fewer inputs.
Initially, minterms or maxterms are classified according to Hamming's distance.
Then if they merge into a larger cube, they merge. The non-integrated cube is considered the main implant (PI) and the main implant, which contains at least one essential or maximum material, is considered the basic implant (EPI).
Finally, the number and logical proposition of PIs, EPIs are returned as output.
